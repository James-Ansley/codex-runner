### Question Format

To start, question data must be added to a TOML file that contains for each
question:

- A unique ID
- A prompt
- An answer preload (optional but recommended)
- Several testcases each containing (optional):
    - Code
    - Stdin
    - Expected output
- Several support files that will be placed in the working dir each containing
  (optional):
  - Name
  - Text

Additional data will be generated by these scripts that does not need to be
manually added.

The general TOML format is as follows:

```toml
# You can have several questions in one file
[[questions]]
id = 'greeting'
prompt = '''
Write a function called greeting(name) that takes a name as input and prints Hello, <name>! as in the examples below.

>>> greeting("James")
Hello, James!
>>> greeting("Sue")
Hello, Sue!
'''
# Optional but recommended a function header is included here.
answer_preload = '''
def greeting(name):
'''

# Generated by running the gen and check commands
# You do not need to write these yourself
[[questions.completions]]
code = '''
# Python 3
def greeting(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
'''
[[questions.completions.test_results]]
code = '''
greeting("James")
'''
stdin = ''
expect = '''
Hello, James!
'''
got = '''
Hello, James!
'''
is_correct = true  # Note – this field is ignored when parsing. It is only for convenience when checking outputs
[[questions.completions.test_results]]
code = '''
greeting("Sue")
'''
stdin = ''
expect = '''
Hello, Sue!
'''
got = '''
Hello, Sue!
'''
is_correct = true

# Optional – You will need to write testcases yourself
# If no testcases are provided you will not be able to auto-mark questions
[[questions.testcases]]
code = '''
greeting("James")
'''
stdin = ''
expect = '''
Hello, James!
'''

[[questions.testcases]]
code = '''
greeting("Sue")
'''
stdin = ''
expect = '''
Hello, Sue!
'''

# Optional – You will need to write testcases yourself
[[questions.support_files]]
name = 'my_file.txt'
text = '''some file data'''

[[questions.support_files]]
name = 'my_other_file.txt'
text = '''some file data
in another file.'''
```
